# Body Design

## Dimensions

Base: 18" x 12"

Side Panels: 9" x 18"

End Plates: 9" x 12"

Shelf: 15" x 11"

## Material

The body can be made of nearly any material. It is reccomended to use a plastic such as acrylic for prototyping. The material should have a thickness of 0.22".

If using an acrylic, an adhesive such as WeldOn #4 will be suitable.

For best results, using a waterjet to cut the acrylic will provide perfect fixment. However, a circular saw will work, but with less precise results.
